# Retail-Shop-Simulator
Retail Shop Simulation project is based on a model of a store where consumers may come, make purchases and pay for them. The simulation includes variables for the shopâ€™s opening and closing  times, average customer entry times, typical quantity of items each customer purchases and the number of payment terminals in the store.
